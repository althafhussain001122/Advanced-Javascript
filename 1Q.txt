function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    
    this.sayHello = function() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
    };
}

// Example of using the Person constructor
const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
person1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.

The Person constructor initializes name and age.
The sayHello method prints a greeting that includes the person's name and age.
You can create a new instance of Person using the new keyword and call the sayHello method on that instance.
